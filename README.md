### Important Information

- Each folder containing a Program has a `.txt` file with a brief description.

- Anyone can Read/Write. 

- Examples will be put in `example.file_extension`. 

- Mains will be put in `main.file_extension`.

- If you want to add a file, put your initials, `initials_example.file_extension`. 

- Most files will be in `.asm`, and compiled and linked to an `.o`, and `.bin` files. 

- Remember, a computer only understands machine, 1s and 0s. 

- I have a Discord Server where we can discuss. Ilios Selene's Reactor. 

- They're not many, but for the sake of (what's the word?), I put my personal thoughts inside () in the README.md file. 

Nice Project!

### Boot Process
#### Intro

- There are two kinds of Booting: Cold and Warm Booting.
 
- There is Real Mode and Protected Mode. 
 
- The Instruction Pointer (EIP) holds the Memory Addresses of the Instructions.
 
#### Reset Vector

- The Reset vector is at `0xFFFFFFF0`.
 
- It is the first Instruction executed. 

- The Motherboard ensures that the Instruction at `0xFFFFFFF0` is a Jump to the memory location mapped to the BIOS Entry Point.  

#### Bios

- We start off in Real Mode. 

- The BIOS is the first thing to boot.

- The BIOS is stored on ROM and FLASH Memory, at `0xFFFFF`.

- It copies itself to RAM, Shadowing. 

- `0xFFFFFFFF` has a jump instruction to where the it Shadowed.

- The BIOS will perform POST.

- It will look for Bootable Devices.
 
 - The BIOS will only boot an MBR from a device if that device is in the Boot Sequence, and if it formatted correctly. 

- The BIOS will load the Master Boot Record at `0x7c00`, containing the Bootloader.

#### Master Boot Record 

- Concept:

- When the BIOS looks for Bootable Devices:
 
- It calls code stored in the Master Boot Record at the start of disk 0. 

- It launches the first 440 bytes (the Master Boot Record Bootstrap Code area). 
 
- The next 6 bytes are for Optional Code. 

- The next 64 bytes (4 x 16) are for four Partion Code. 

- The last 2 bytes are for Boot Signature, `0x55, 0xaa`.

- Explain: 

- The BIOS iterates through the Master Boot Record/Boot Sector, the first 512 bytes.

- This ends in `0x55, 0xaa`.

- The Master Boot Record is the Boot Sector of a Hard Disk. First 512 bytes. 
 
- There are three sections to the Master Boot Record: Master Boot Routine, Disk Partition Table, Identification Code.

- The first 446 bytes `0x000 - 0x1BC` hold Bootstrap and Optional Code, the Master Boot Routine. The next 4 x 16 bytes `0x1BE - 0x1EE` contain four Partitions, the Disk Partition Table. The last 2 bytes `0x1FE`, are for the Boot Signature, `0x55, 0xaa`, Identification Code. 

- The Boot Signature tells the BIOS it is bootable. 

- The Master Boot Record will load the Bootloader. Stage 1 and Stage 2 Code. 

#### Bootloader

- It has First Stage, Second Stage, Embedded and Multi Stage, and Network Booting. 

- It will Load Filesystem Drivers, Configuration File, Supporting Modules, Display Menu, Load Operating System. 

- The Bootloader will start the Kernel at `0x100000`. 

#### Kernel 

- We are in Protected Mode.

- There are Main, and SubSet Kernel Models. 

- Main: Monolithic, Micro Kernels. 

- SubSet: Hybrid, Modular, Nano, Exo, Kernels

- They act as a Interface between User Applications and Hardware.

- They're the Core Components of an Operating System.

- They have four functions: Memory management, Process management, Device Driver, and System calls and Security.

- The Kernel initializes the Operating System.

#### Operating System

- The Operating System is an Interface between User Applications and Hardware. 

- It takes full control with the Kernel running in the background.

- It will run it's own initializations. 

That's it!

- All Programs coded with research, using Visual Studio Code IDE, with knwoledge of Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal Number Systems, and with Assembly, Python, C/C++ Programming Languages, and finally, with Engineering,  and Architecture, which are a huge part of Computer Science. 

- For testing the Programs, Emulated with QEMU, and Assembled with NASM.

- This is for X86 ISAs made by Intel and AMD.

I'll be one step closer to designing the Reactors.
